![Bird][logo]

## Description
```
This Project was designed for the sole purpose of re-creating the beloved game Flappy Bird from iOS & Android App Store / Play Store for our Final Project for ICS4U in Turing. We recieved a perfect mark for this Project (thank you Mr.Vandenberg).
```
# How to Run

1) Install Turing from: http://compsci.ca/blog/download-turing-411/

(If you're on a Mac, it's a pain to install Turing. It involves downloading Wine, WineBottler, etc. If I were you, just run it through a Windows VM).

2) Un-zip this file and run ```main.t``` with Turing.

and voila, just click on the ```Run``` button to get started.

Enjoy! :)
